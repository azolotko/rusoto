If\nthe data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using\n`NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the\nattribute \"`a`\" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`\ncomparison operator.\n    * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.\nIf the data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,\nthe result is a Boolean _false_.

If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.\nIf the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator\nlooks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target\nattribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\", or \"`BS`\"), then the\noperator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the\nset.\nCONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a CONTAINS b`\", \"`a`\" can\nbe a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a\nsubstring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the\noperator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches\nthe input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\",\nor \"`BS`\"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact\nmatch with any member of the set.\nNOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a NOT CONTAINS b`\",\n\"`a`\" can be a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or\nBinary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison\nmust be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).\n    * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared\nagainst an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the\ninput set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.\n    * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. \n_AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same\ntype, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute\nmatches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element\nand less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not compare\nto `{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`\nFor usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see\n[Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late\nst/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB\nDeveloper Guide_.\nFor backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following\nparameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and\n_ComparisonOperator_:\n  * _Value_ \\- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.\n  * _Exists_ \\- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:\n    * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table.

These attributes are compared\nagainst an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the\ninput set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.\n    * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. \n_AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same\ntype, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).

If _Value_ is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.\nIf you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an item that\ndoesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.\nIn addition, if you use `ADD` to update an existing item, and intend to\nincrement or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB\nuses `0` as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to\nupdate does not yet have an attribute named _itemcount_, but you decide to\n`ADD` the number `3` to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does\nnot exist. DynamoDB will create the _itemcount_ attribute, set its initial\nvalue to `0`, and finally add `3` to it.

Also,\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `GE` : Greater than or equal. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not equal\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `GT` : Greater than. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not equal\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If\nthe data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using\n`NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the\nattribute \"`a`\" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`\ncomparison operator.\n    * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.\nIf the data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,\nthe result is a Boolean _false_. This is because the attribute \"`a`\" exists;\nits data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.\n    * `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.\nIf the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator\nlooks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target\nattribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\", or \"`BS`\"), then the\noperator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the\nset.\nCONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a CONTAINS b`\", \"`a`\" can\nbe a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a\nsubstring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the\noperator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches\nthe input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\",\nor \"`BS`\"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact\nmatch with any member of the set.\nNOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a NOT CONTAINS b`\",\n\"`a`\" can be a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or\nBinary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison\nmust be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).\n    * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared\nagainst an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the\ninput set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.\n    * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. \n_AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same\ntype, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute\nmatches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element\nand less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not compare\nto `{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`\nFor usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see\n[Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late\nst/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB\nDeveloper Guide_.\nFor backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following\nparameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and\n_ComparisonOperator_:\n  * _Value_ \\- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.\n  * _Exists_ \\- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:\n    * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.\n    * If _Exists_ is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does _not_ exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the condition evaluates to false.\nNote that the default value for _Exists_ is `true`.\nThe _Value_ and _Exists_ parameters are incompatible with _AttributeValueList_\nand _ComparisonOperator_.

Once the index begins backfilling, you can use _UpdateTable_ to perform other operations.\n_UpdateTable_ is an asynchronous operation; while it is executing, the table\nstatus changes from `ACTIVE` to `UPDATING`.

You identify requested items by primary key.\nA single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many\nas 100 items. _BatchGetItem_ will return a partial result if the response size\nlimit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an\ninternal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the\noperation returns a value for _UnprocessedKeys_. You can use this value to\nretry the operation starting with the next item to get.\nIf you request more than 100 items _BatchGetItem_ will return a\n_ValidationException_ with the message \"Too many items requested for the\nBatchGetItem call\".\nFor example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300\nKB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit).\nIt also returns an appropriate _UnprocessedKeys_ value so you can get the next\npage of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to\nassemble the pages of results into one data set.\nIf _none_ of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned\nthroughput on all of the tables in the request, then _BatchGetItem_ will\nreturn a _ProvisionedThroughputExceededException_. If _at least one_ of the\nitems is successfully processed, then _BatchGetItem_ completes successfully,\nwhile returning the keys of the unread items in _UnprocessedKeys_.\nIf DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch\noperation on those items. However, _we strongly recommend that you use an\nexponential backoff algorithm_. If you retry the batch operation immediately,\nthe underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the\nindividual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff,\nthe individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.\nFor more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](http://docs.aw\ns.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOper\nations) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.\nBy default, _BatchGetItem_ performs eventually consistent reads on every table\nin the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set\n_ConsistentRead_ to `true` for any or all tables.\nIn order to minimize response latency, _BatchGetItem_ retrieves items in\nparallel.\nWhen designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return\nattributes in any particular order. To help parse the response by item,\ninclude the primary key values for the items in your request in the\n_AttributesToGet_ parameter.\nIf a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests\nfor nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the\ntype of read.

To have DynamoDB return\nfewer items, you can provide a _ScanFilter_ operation.\nIf the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum data set size limit\nof 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a\n_LastEvaluatedKey_ value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The\nresults also include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can\nresult in no table data meeting the filter criteria.\nBy default, _Scan_ operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster\nperformance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a\nparallel _Scan_ operation by providing the _Segment_ and _TotalSegments_\nparameters. For more information, see [Parallel Scan](http://docs.aws.amazon.c\nom/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html#QueryAndScanParallel\nScan) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.\nBy default, _Scan_ uses eventually consistent reads when acessing the data in\nthe table or local secondary index.

Individual items to be\nwritten can be as large as 400 KB.\n_BatchWriteItem_ cannot update items. To update items, use the _UpdateItem_\nAPI.\nThe individual _PutItem_ and _DeleteItem_ operations specified in\n_BatchWriteItem_ are atomic; however _BatchWriteItem_ as a whole is not. If\nany requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is\nexceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are\nreturned in the _UnprocessedItems_ response parameter. You can investigate and\noptionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call _BatchWriteItem_ in\na loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new\n_BatchWriteItem_ request with those unprocessed items until all items have\nbeen processed.\nNote that if _none_ of the items can be processed due to insufficient\nprovisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then\n_BatchWriteItem_ will return a _ProvisionedThroughputExceededException_.\nIf DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch\noperation on those items.

In order to improve performance with these large-scale\noperations, _BatchWriteItem_ does not behave in the same way as individual\n_PutItem_ and _DeleteItem_ calls would. For example, you cannot specify\nconditions on individual put and delete requests, and _BatchWriteItem_ does\nnot return deleted items in the response.\nIf you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use\nthreads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the\nnecessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support\nthreading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In\nboth situations, _BatchWriteItem_ provides an alternative where the API\nperforms the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the\npower of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into\nyour application.\nParallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request\nconsumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in\nparallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write\ncapacity unit.\nIf one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch\nwrite operation:\n  * One or more tables specified in the _BatchWriteItem_ request does not exist.\n  * Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.\n  * You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same _BatchWriteItem_ request.
